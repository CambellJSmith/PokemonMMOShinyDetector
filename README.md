# PokemonMMOShinyDetector  
This script will walk you around and then run away from non shinies. Shinies will be waiting for you.  

This is a completely self made pyautoGUI script for PokemonMMO. It will walk up and down repeatedly and with some randomisation to protect from bot checks. 
When you enter battle it will use OpenCV to recognise if the pokemon you are fighting is a shiny.  
If it is not a shiny then the bot will run away from the battle and start walking again.  
If it is a shiny then the bot will not run and willjust play the walking around code to keep the session active.  
When you come back to your device the shiny will be waiting for you to catch it.
